# Tripbook

_An application for easily planning vacations and trips_

Tripbook came about when while planning a year-long trip around the world with my wife.
To make thinks clearer and ensures the right information gets added for each country, I created an app which requires specific information regarding each country the user plans to travel to. Each country's information is stored in an easy to navigate dashboard for future reference.
